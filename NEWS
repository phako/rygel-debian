Brief summary of changes since 0.3:

- Rygel is no more just a MediaServer but rather a collection of DLNA (UPnP AV)
  services (devices in UPnP speak).
- Port to new GUPnP APIs. The biggest advantage of that is that we now have
  dynamic network support, i-e Rygel can attach/detach to/from a network
  interface as it goes up/down.
- Support for time-based seeking in transcoded streams.
- Random tweaks to transcoding pipelines.
- Provide a DBus service providing two functionalities:
   * Ability to tell Rygel to shutdown. Starting of Rygel is automatically
     handled by D-Bus since a .service file is provided by Rygel.
   * Ability to tell Rygel (MediaExport plugin actually) to (un)export URIs on
     the fly.
- Implement enabling/disabling of UPnP in the preferences.
- Configuration through command-line options.
- Use a .ini configuration file rather than gconf.
- Special default configuration for Maemo.
- Don't spam the user's config directory and instead keep the description files
  into a separate subdirectory.
- `make clean` doesn't clean the generated C files anymore.
- Remove "all rights reserved" part from all copyright headers.
- Remove integrated DVB plugin as DVBDaemon now implements the external plugin
  interface and hence dynamically glues to Rygel, just like PulseAudio.
- New classes to further ease the plugin implementation.
- (Un)pause the SoupMessage at the right time. This was causing a lot of delays
  when playing media on Sony PS3.
- Bitrate is supposed to be in bytes/second. Not really but tell that to writers
  of UPnP specification.
- Expose transcode formats in the GetProtocolInfo's source argument. This should
  make Sony Bravia TVs happy.
- Transcoder URIs are now sorted according to their distance from the original
  format.
- Provide "contentFeatures.dlna.org" header in the HTTP responses.
- Provide DLNA transferMode header in the HTTP responses.
- Only advertise internal URIs on local loopback interface.
- Replace 'ip' config by 'interface' so users can bind Rygel to interfaces
  rather than IP.
- Allow plugins to provide thumbnails.
- Add thumbnails (if available) for each item if none provided by plugins. This
  works both on the desktop and Maemo.
- Suppress all C compiler warnings by default. These warnings are mostly useless
  for us since almost all C code is generated.
- Preference dialog is now more like a GNOME preferences dialog.
- Provide .desktop file for preferences dialog.
- Shave the build output.
- GstLaunch: New plugin that exposes gstreamer pipelines described using
  familiar gst-launch syntax in the user configuration.
- Tracker plugin:
  - Nicer default title.
  - Better detection of Tracker availability. Apparently ubuntu folks think that
    providing a .service file is wrong.
  - Better titles for top-level folders.
  - More usable hierarchy: Browsing by artists, albums and tags.
- Folder plugin:
  - Rename to MediaExport.
  - Nicer default title.
  - Use the new Rygel classes to extract, export and save media metadata.
  - notify about updates to containers.
  - Skip files/folders starting with '.'.
  - Avoid crash if unknown file is found.
  - Delete gone directories on new start.
  - React on deletion of files.
  - Add recursive file monitoring.
  - Provide simple and easy options to add and remove files and folders from the
    preferences UI.
- External plugin:
  - actually use 'DLNAProfile' property.
  - Don't load the plugin more than once.
  - Utilise optional MediaItem properties.
  - Fetch items on demand.
  - Fix critical warnings.
- Mediathek plugin:
  - Fix crash if no config is available.

Brief summary of changes since 0.2.2:

- Transcoding from any format (that gstreamer's decodebin2 can handle) to mp3,
  linear PCM and mpeg transport stream containing mpeg 2 video and mp2 audio.
- Plugin API to deal with user preferences.
- User preferences UI: rygel-preferences.
- New plugins:
   * Folder: Recursively exports folders specified in the user preferences.
   * ZDFMediathek: Exports online media from 2nd German TV station.
   * External: Exports media hierarchies provided by external applications
     through implementation of this spec:
     http://live.gnome.org/Rygel/MediaServer. The first application
     that utilizes this feature is PulseAudio.
- Drop xbox support. It didn't work anyway and we better concentrate on
  implementing standard stuff that it at least worthy of being called "UPnP" (
  at least for now).
- Tracker and DVB plugins are only loaded if their corresponding services are
  available.
- Export of duration for music and video items from Tracker.
- Use HTTP EOF encoding rather the CHUNKED for live streams.
- Ability to build rygel plugins outside it's source tree.
- HTTP proxying only if needed.
- Now that gupnp-av does DLNA profile guessing for us, no need to lie about
  DLNA profile anymore.
- Add a summary after configure.
- HTTServer is now internal API.
- Use git-version-gen to generate package version.
- Differentiate between modules and plugins
- Passive, asynchronous plugin loading. A side-effect of which is that modules
  can now load more than one plugin.
- Differentiate between name and title of the plugin.
- Plugins can now dynamically change their availability.
- Add API to get/list plugins.
- Re-use existing description from user's home directory. This not only speeds
  the start-up but also obsoletes the necessity to keep immutable data (e.g UDN)
  in user preferences.
- Provide gconf schemas.
- Lots of other improvements and bug fixes.

Dependency-related changes:

- Explicitly require and link to libsoup-2.4 >= 2.26.0.
- Don't require Vala (and bindings) in distribution tarball.
- Require gupnp-av >= 0.4.
- Require Vala >= 0.7.3.
- Require Gtk+ >= 2.16 if preferences UI is not disabled.

Bugs fixed in this release:

582173 - git-version-gen: generate versions with - instead of .
577000 - gupnp-av-cp does not like & in uris
576998 - Rygel wants to transcode audio files to video/mpeg
575935 - Add support for duration metadata field
574604 – bug connecting to PS3

0.2.2
=====

Changes since 0.2:

- Use the new (0.6.9) Tracker API.
- Priority of gio-based streams are based on requested DLNA transfer mode.
- GIO-based/like asynchronous plugin API.
- Adapt to latest changes in gupnp-vala API.
- Serialization of media objects isn't done by media objects themselve
  anymore, but by a new separate class, Rygel.DIDLLiteWriter.
- Internal API is marked 'internal' so it doesn't get to our (Vala) API.
- MediaObject now derives from GLib.Object.
- Generic AsyncResult implementation, SimpleAsyncResult.
- StateMachine interface that all state machines classes implement.
- Visible performance improvements in Tracker plugin by proper use of Tracker
  APIs.
- Use Filename.to_string() and therefore make Bastien happy.
- Require lastest version (0.1.5) of libgee to use List.slice().
- Don't limit the number of objects returned to a client, let it decide
  that on it's own.
- Proper handling of update notification to the client by use of a very simple
  bubble-up mechanism for containers to signal updates.
- Decrease needed gconf version to 2.16.
- Set application name and therefore make Lennart happy.
- Require latest version of vala (0.5.7) and gupnp-vala (0.5.3).
- Allow multiple URIs for each media items.
- Response for seekable media request is now sent buffer by buffer so the whole
  file is not put into memory.
- Some improvements to build system.
- Lots of other improvements and bugfixes.

0.2
===

The major change after last release (as gupnp-media-server) is the introduction
of a simple yet powerful plugin-based architecture/api: Every plugin:
- is loaded into a separate MediaServer instance.
- can implement any kind and number of resources (currently only services).
- can export an icon file.
- inherit it's ContentDirectory implementation from a base class that does most
  of the UPnP-related work. More improvements on this planned for next release.
- use an intuitive API to easily export media from URIs and live GStreamer
  source elements over HTTP.

Other changes:

- Relicense under LGPL to allow proprietary plugins and ease of moving code
  from/to gupnp libraries.
- DVB Daemon integration though a plugin. Now you can watch live channels from
  your PC on your PS3 for example.
- Test plugin that exports one audio and video item, streaming contents from
  GStreamer's audiotestsrc and videotestsrc elements respectively.
- Better interoperability with Sony playstation 3.
- Announce unavailability to UPnP world on exit.
- Loads of other improvements.
