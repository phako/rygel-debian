What is Rygel?
=============

Rygel is a collection of DLNA (UPnP AV) devices, implemented through a plug-in
mechanism.

Important facts and features
============================

  * Specifically designed for GNOME (Mobile) and is therefore planned to be one
    of the key new features of GNOME 3.0 and Maemo platform in the Harmattan
    release.
  * Based on GUPnP.
  * Written entirely in Vala language.
  * APIs to ease the implementation of AV devices (currently only MediaServer
    version 2.0 specification.
  * Export of on-disk media:
    * Tracker plugin.
    * MediaExport plugin: Recursively exports folders and files specified in
                          the user configuration. This plugin supports all
                          types of URIs that gio/gvfs and gstreamer can handle.
  * Export of online media from 2nd German TV station.
  * Export of media hierarchies provided by external applications through
    implementation of D-Bus MediaServer spec. Applications that utilize
    this feature are:
    * PulseAudio: Provides streams for input/output devices on the system.
    * DVB Daemon: Provides live TV (DVB) channel streams.
  * Export of GStreamer pipelines as media items on the network, specified
    through gst-launch syntax in the user configuration.
  * Audio and Video Transcoding: source format could be anything GStreamer's
    decodebin2 can handle but output formats are currently limited to: mp3, PCM
    and MPEG TS. Fortunately the transcoding framework is flexible enough to
    easily add more transcoding targets.

Requirements
============

  * Build-time:
    * Core:
      * gupnp
      * gupnp-av
      * dbus-glib
      * gstreamer
      * gio (part of glib source package)
      * libgee
      * libuuid
      * libsoup
      * vala (not if building from release tarballs)
      * gupnp-vala (not if building from release tarballs)
    * Preferences UI:
      * gtk+
    * MediaExport:
      * sqlite3
  * Run-time:
    * Definitely needed:
      * gst-plugins-base
    * Might be needed (depending on your usage and media collection):
      * gst-plugins-good
      * gst-ffmpeg
      * gst-plugins-bad
      * gst-plugins-ugly
