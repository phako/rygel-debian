Description: GNOME UPnP/DLNA services
 Rygel is a collection of DLNA (UPnP AV) services (devices in UPnP speak),
 implemented through a plug-in mechanism. Important facts and features:
 .
   * APIs to ease the implementation of AV devices (currently only
     MediaServer V 2.0 specification).
 .
   * Audio and Video Transcoding: source format could be anything
     GStreamer's decodebin2 can handle but output formats are currently
     limited to: mp3, PCM and MPEG TS. Fortunately the transcoding
     framework is flexible enough to easily add more transcoding targets.
 .
   * Specifically designed for GNOME (Mobile).
 .
   * Based on GUPnP.
 .
   * Written (mostly) in Vala language.
 .
 This package contains the core of Rygel and following plugins:
 .
   * media-export: Recursively exports folders and files specified in the
     user configuration. This plugin supports all types of URIs that
     gio/gvfs and GStreamer can handle.
 .
   * external: A MediaServer plugin that exports media hierarchies
     provided by external applications.
